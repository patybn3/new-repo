House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark went to King's landing where he made lots of friends and lived
happily ever after...  He definitely didn't get axe murdered.

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to begin, and let me assure you he will do a fancy dance on top of the castle. He's a nice guy. Really sweet. Like total humanitarian. Cares about everyone and LOVES animals.
